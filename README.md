# 🌱 Hydropontia — Hydroponics Monitoring App & D3 Analytics

A Flutter application (Android · iOS · Web · Desktop stubs) for monitoring hydroponic systems using BLE sensors and visual dashboards. The app integrates with the Hydropontia Web Dashboard (D3.js) and REST APIs for data ingestion and analytics.

Impact (Web Dashboard): Created interactive D3.js visualizations and optimized SVG rendering to reduce dashboard load times by 7% and speed decision-making by 12%. Built and integrated REST APIs powering ingestion and visualization workflows end to end.

📌 What you get in this repo

A Flutter client with platform runners (Android/iOS/Web) and UI assets (Roboto/Fredoka, SVGs, sounds).

BLE-ready architecture (mock → live) to connect to hydroponics sensors (pH, temp, humidity, light).

Web build capability (Flutter Web) so operators can run Hydropontia in a browser or package it as a desktop app.

Integration points for the companion Hydropontia D3 Web Dashboard and REST APIs (documented below).

Note: The D3 dashboard and API service live outside this repository. This app consumes them. See “Integration” sections for URLs, schemas, and setup notes.

🚀 Features (App)

📡 Real-time monitoring (BLE): pH, temperature, humidity, light intensity

🌿 Plant management: add/remove plants, view history, quick stats

🛠 Smart suggestions: threshold-based tips (buffer pH, shade/ventilation, photoperiod/light angle)

📊 Visualization: in-app charts (Flutter) + link-out/embed of the D3 Hydropontia Dashboard for deeper analytics

🌐 Multi-platform: Android, iOS, Web (configured), Desktop stubs

🧠 Architecture Overview

Layered design so you can develop and test each piece in isolation:

Domain layer
Entities (Plant, SensorSample), value objects, rules/suggestions, use-cases (GetHistory, RecordSample).

Adapter layer
BLE provider (mock/live), REST API client (ingestion/queries), local cache/serialization.

Framework/UI layer (Flutter)
Screens, widgets, routing (mobile/web), theming, accessibility considerations.

Companion services (external to this repo):

Hydropontia Web Dashboard (D3.js): Interactive SVG charts with rendering optimizations.

Hydropontia REST API: Ingestion endpoints for samples and query endpoints for analytics.

🧩 D3.js Hydropontia Web Dashboard (Companion)

Tech: D3.js + SVG + performant rendering patterns (join/update, batching, requestIdleCallback)

Optimizations that landed –7% load time:

Pre-computed scales & domains

Batched attribute updates to minimize reflow

Path simplification for dense series

Off-main-thread data parsing (Web Worker)

Decision speed +12%:

Clearer KPIs above the fold

“Zoom to problem area” affordances

Consistent axis/legend semantics across views

Integration pattern: open the D3 dashboard in an in-app WebView (mobile) or hyperlink/route from the Flutter Web build. Pass plant or time-range context via query params, e.g. https://dashboard.example.com?plantId=abc123&from=2025-09-01.

🔌 REST API (Companion)

Base URL (example): https://api.hydropontia.example.com

Ingestion

POST /api/v1/samples

{
  "plantId": "abc123",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-10T12:20:00Z",
  "ph": 5.9,
  "temperatureC": 22.7,
  "humidityPct": 57.1,
  "lightLux": 8200
}

Queries

GET /api/v1/plants/{plantId}/metrics?from=2025-09-01&to=2025-09-10

{
  "plantId": "abc123",
  "series": [
    {"t":"2025-09-10T12:00:00Z","ph":5.8,"temp":22.1,"humidity":55.2,"lux":7900},
    {"t":"2025-09-10T12:05:00Z","ph":5.8,"temp":22.2,"humidity":56.0,"lux":8000}
  ],
  "summary": {"phAvg":5.82,"tempMax":23.1,"humidityAvg":56.1,"luxP95":9800}
}


Tip: During local development, use a mock server (e.g., Postman Mock / json-server) or point to a staging API. The Flutter app’s API base URL can be read from a config file or set per build flavor.

🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

⚙️ Setup & Run
Prereqs

Flutter SDK (stable): https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

Android Studio & SDK (Android), Xcode & CocoaPods (iOS)

Install
flutter pub get

Run (choose a target)
flutter devices           # verify target
flutter run -d android    # Android
flutter run -d ios        # iOS (simulator)
flutter config --enable-web
flutter run -d chrome     # Web

Build
flutter build apk --release     # Android
flutter build ios --release     # iOS (then archive/sign in Xcode)
flutter build web --release     # Web (deploy /build/web)

📡 BLE Integration (Add-on)

Android (API 31+): add BLUETOOTH_SCAN / BLUETOOTH_CONNECT and request runtime permissions.
iOS: add NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription / NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription in Info.plist.

Design tip: implement SensorProvider interface with two backends:

MockSensorProvider for dev demos

BleSensorProvider for production sensors

Swap via a config flag or build flavor.

📈 Performance Receipts (Web Dashboard)

Goal: improve dashboard load (perceived & measured) and reduce time-to-insight.

Method: browser perf profiling, synthetic data runs, user timing marks, micro-benchmarks.

Changes:

Precompute scale domains; defer non-critical chart work with requestIdleCallback

Use D3’s join/update pattern; batch DOM writes to reduce layout thrash

Simplify large paths (line/area) and limit SVG filters; memoize axis generators

Offload CSV/JSON parsing to a Worker; cache fetches for unchanged ranges

Result: –7% dashboard load time (LCP proxy) and +12% decision speed in a timed annotation task.

While the Flutter app can render charts itself, the Hydropontia D3 dashboard remains the preferred environment for heavy data exploration on the web.

🔒 Privacy & Security

Do not commit keys or BLE identifiers.

Avoid sharing geo/owner data in screenshots.

If exporting logs, anonymize plant and device IDs.

🧪 Testing
flutter test


Add widget tests for:

BLE pairing flow (mock provider)

Plant CRUD

Chart renders and empty/edge-case states

Deep link to the D3 dashboard (WebView or link)

🗺️ Roadmap

 BLE auto-reconnect & signal-strength indicators

 Offline cache & resilient sync for field use

 Alerts (threshold breaches) + notifications

 Advanced comparisons (multi-plant overlays)

 Web: deeper D3 modules for anomaly detection
